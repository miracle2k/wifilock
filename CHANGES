2.0.0 (2009-05-25)
	* Cupcake now features a "Wi-Fi sleep policy" setting that sort of
	  obsoletes our core functionality. Instead, when running on Cupcake,
	  we now simply function as a quick-toggle tool for said setting.

1.1.2 (2009-04-26)
    * Exclude ourselves from recent activities list (suggested by Mariano
      Kamp).
    * Better handle quick toggling, by reusing an existing toast rather
      than queuing them.
    * Increased perceived speed by using an autostart setting rather than
      disabling the boot receiver (slow!).
    * Added German localization.

1.1.0 (2009-03-12)
    * Added boot persistence.
    * Fixed Typo in toast message.

1.0.1 (2009-02-25)
    * No longer show notifications when service is auto-restarted by Android.

1.0.0 (2009-02-24)
    Initial release.
