- German localization.

- (optional) Notification Icon indicating whether we are
  on or off (suggested via Market comments).

- Option to combine with wifi toggle feature, switching 
  on Wifi *and*  enabling the lock in one click. Although 
  this might really be unnecessary once boot persistance 
  is implemented since you basically can just leave it 
  always on. Let's see about this ((suggested via Market 
  comments).
  
- Is it wise to refresh the WifiLock once in a time to be
  on the safe side? There are also issues like:

- Optionally force disable usage of a data plan in any 
  case (suggested by Ayman El-Ghazali). If Android does not
  support this per se, we could temporarily modify all APN 
  records. All in all, not sure if this is really something
  we should implement.
