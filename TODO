- German localization.

- (optional) Notification Icon indicating whether we are
  on or off (suggested via Market comments).

- Option to combine with wifi toggle feature, switching 
  on Wifi *and*  enabling the lock in one click. Although 
  this might really be unnecessary once boot persistence 
  is implemented since you basically can just leave it 
  always on. Let's see about this ((suggested via Market 
  comments).
  
- Is it wise to refresh the WifiLock once in a time to be
  on the safe side? There are also issues like:
  http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2059
  
- Optionally force disable usage of a data plan in any 
  case (suggested by Ayman El-Ghazali). If Android does not
  support this per se, we could temporarily modify all APN 
  records. All in all, not sure if this is really something
  we should implement.
  
- Make a bunch of behavior, like boot persistence, 
  optional. To do this, we'd have to introduce a 
  configuration dialog. It'd be cool if we could hook into
  the system settings, but we can't, so the best option 
  would be to use our own settings activity that replaces
  the current toggle system, and an additional setting that
  allows the user to opt into the toggle system. In this 
  case, the settings would be unavailable from this point on, 
  until the application data is cleared through the 
  application manager.
  
  Alternatively, we could have a separate icon in the 
  application launcher that starts the settings activity, 
  and for users who prefer not to have two icons a setting
  could be provided that disables the activity (via
  setComponentEnabledSetting), which *should* allow us to
  make the icon disappear. 
  
- It feels like the time it takes to show the toast 
  increased in 1.1.0 - measure if the setComponentEnabledSetting
  call indeed is responsible for this, and if so, show the 
  toast first, then do the call.  
  
- Locale plugin.
