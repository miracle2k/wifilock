- Remember the enabled/disabled status and restore on boot.

- German localization.

- (optional) Notification Icon indicating whether we are
  on or off (suggested via Market comments).
  
- Some guy on the market complained about getting the "enabled"
  message every 30 seconds. This sounds like his service is 
  being restarted due to low memory. There are basically a 
  couple issues here:
  
        - When the service is killed and restarted, we 
          theoretically need to maintain state. However,
          since the service is only running when the 
          feature should be active, this *seems* like a 
          non-issue. Running always means enabled.
  
        - The toast though should possibly be shown by 
          the controlling toggler activity, so that the
          user will not see notifications when the 
          service restarts.

- Option to combine with wifi toggle feature, switching 
  on Wifi *and*  enabling the lock in one click. Although 
  this might really be unnecessary once boot persistance 
  is implemented since you basically can just leave it 
  always on. Let's see about this ((suggested via Market 
  comments).
  
- Is it wise to refresh the WifiLock once in a time to be
  on the safe side? There are also issues like:
